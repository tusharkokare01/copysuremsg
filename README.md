# copysuremsg
The Problem: Sometimes when you press Ctrl+C, you aren't sure if the computer actually registered the command. This creates "copy discomfort" and leads to double-tapping keys. The Solution: A ultra-lightweight tool that shows a small, elegant "Copied!" popup near your mouse cursor or at the corner of the screen whenever a copy command is successful
