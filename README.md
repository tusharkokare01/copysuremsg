**Eliminate "Copy Discomfort" with instant visual feedback.**

### 💡 The Problem

Have you ever pressed `Ctrl+C` and felt unsure if the computer actually registered the command? This often leads to "double-tapping" or "triple-tapping" the keys just to be safe. This small friction in your daily workflow is what we call **Copy Discomfort**.

### ✨ The Solution

**copysuremsg** is an ultra-lightweight Windows utility that provides a sleek, non-intrusive "Copied!" popup near your mouse cursor the moment a copy command is successful.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Visual Confirmation:** Instant tooltip appears exactly where you are looking (at the cursor).
* **Smart Triggering:** It only pops up if the clipboard content *actually* changes.
* **Click-Through UI:** The message doesn't block your mouse; you can click right through it.
* **Ultra-Lightweight:** Uses less than 2MB of RAM.
